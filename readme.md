### About the project
This SMSbot, nicknamed `You Never Walk Alone` or `YNWA` for short, combines Twilio's SMS services with Google Cloud Functions to allow BTS Army to seamlessly recieve comfort or encouragement from a BTS Member via text message. The name for the project came from from BTS's song "[A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zu-7sgObQ4)", from their 2016 album YOU NEVER WALK ALONE.

## How to use YNWA 
The textbot is easy to use:
- Text the name of a member to +1(725)226-4826 from your phone
- The chatbot will respond with a photo and quote by that member 

Currently these are how the members can be chosen: (not case sensitive)
- `Seokjin`: `seokjin`, `jin`
- `Namjoon`: `namjoon`, `joon`, `namu` 
- `Yoongi`: `yoongi`, `yoonfi`, `suga`
- `Hoseok`: `hoseok`, `hobi`, `jhope`, `j-hope`
- `Jimin`: `jimin`, `mini`
- `Taehyung`: `taehyung`, `tae`, `v`
- `Jungkook`: `jk`, `jungkook`, `kookie`, `koo`

### Features
Currently you can only ask YNWA for one member, but in the future I plan to implement the following features:
- support for requesting subunits (ex: `sugakookie`, `minimoni`, `2seok`, etc...)
- support for voicenotes in WhatsApp
- support for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Spanish

### About BTS 
BTS's music has a reputation for speaking to all kinds of peoples' hearts. They deliver songs about loving yourself, grappling with depression and anxiety, examining the magic of everyday encounters, and running after your dreams. This short exerpt from their recent Rolling Stones [article](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/new-bts-song-2021-worlds-biggest-band-1166441/) describes their global impact quite well.

> <i>"In their early days, with their singles “No More Dream” and “N.O.,” BTS wrote directly about the frustrations of South Korean youth, who faced relentless pressure and competition in school and the job market....BTS has since learned that their initial message, along with later lyrics that grapple with identity, self-love, mental health, and much more, had enough wider currency to make them spokesmen for a global generation — literally: They’ve addressed the United Nations General Assembly, twice."</i>

You can find their music on a number of platforms.
