## :purple_heart: You Never Walk Alone :purple_heart:

:construction: I've been notified of a bug and will work on fixing it in the near future, Thank you for your understanding. :construction:

### About the project
This chatbot, nicknamed `You Never Walk Alone` or `YNWA` for short, combines Twilio's SMS services with Google Cloud Functions to allow BTS Army to seamlessly recieve comfort or encouragement from a BTS Member via text message. The name for the project came from from BTS's song "[A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zu-7sgObQ4)", from their 2016 album YOU NEVER WALK ALONE.

## How to use YNWA
The textbot is easy to use:
- Text `BTS` to `+1(725)226-4826` from your phone.
- You should receive a welcome message with some instructions.
  Following the instructions, respond with the name or nickname of a member (listed below).
- `Y.N.W.A` will respond with a photo of the member and a quote.

Currently, these are how the members can be chosen:
- `Namjoon`: `namjoon`, `moni`, `namu`, `rm`
- `Seokjin`: `seokjin`, `jin`
- `Yoongi`: `yoongi`, `yoonfi`, `yoon`,`suga`
- `Hoseok`: `hoseok`, `hobi`, `jhope`
- `Jimin`: `jimin`, `mini`
- `Taehyung`: `taehyung`, `tae`, `tete`, `v`
- `Jungkook`: `jungkook`, `jk`, `koo`

The options aren't case-sensitive, so you can send `Hobi`, or `JIN` to the chatbot and it should still work.

Once you respond to the initial message specifying a member, you can continue to ask `Y.N.W.A.` for other members.
Just reply to the last message sent by `Y.N.W.A.` with another member's name or nickname.

***NOTE -- Currently the chatbot only works with domestic, U.S. phone numbers.
I am working on a Whatsapp-compatible version that will be available internationally to anyone with a whatsapp account.***

### Features in Development
Additional functionalities/features in the pipeline to be added:
- Whatsapp compatibility
- Support for requesting subunits (ex: `sugakookie`, `minimoni`, `2seok`, etc...)
- Allowing punctuation (`jungkook!!!`) and phrases (`minimoni please`)

### Future Features
I'm hoping to add these features in the future, please look forward to them!
- ~~Additional voice-note functionality for WhatsApp~~ **on hold until further notice**
- Language support for other languages including Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Spanish
- Twitter Integration to source photos and quotes from well known accounts

### About BTS
BTS's music has a reputation for speaking to all kinds of peoples' hearts. They deliver songs about loving yourself, grappling with depression and anxiety, examining the magic of everyday encounters, and running after your dreams. This short exerpt from their recent Rolling Stones [article](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/new-bts-song-2021-worlds-biggest-band-1166441/) describes their global impact quite well.

> <i>"In their early days, with their singles “No More Dream” and “N.O.,” BTS wrote directly about the frustrations of South Korean youth, who faced relentless pressure and competition in school and the job market....BTS has since learned that their initial message, along with later lyrics that grapple with identity, self-love, mental health, and much more, had enough wider currency to make them spokesmen for a global generation — literally: They’ve addressed the United Nations General Assembly, twice."</i>

You can find their music on a number of platforms.
